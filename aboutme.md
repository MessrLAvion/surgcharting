Long story short:

I am attending school at WMU in Kalamazoo, MI for Biochemistry and Computer Science. Career aspirations are to work on medical robots like the Divinci 
and to help devise better methods for bringing students up to speed more quickly. 

Interests include writing, charting, investing, cooking, and rowing. 

Currently unemployed :(
